## :label: Description
The purpose of this project was to make a simple and easy way to maintain a list of mods for Minecraft, allowing potentially multiple people to submit requests which could then be approved or rejected by an administrator, allowing for any of the mod pages to be easily accessible in the future to make it easy and quick to update everything when necessary. It also has a public non-administrator list of mods that anybody can have a look at making it particularly useful for organizing modpacks that multiple people will be making / playing. This is entirely a personal project that I threw together out of a desire to both **(a)** make my life easier since I wanted to put together a modpack and keep track of it all neatly, and **(b)** play around some more with React and Mongo.

This repo contains the backend API side of the project, and was put together using Node.js, MongoDB (and it's Mongoose npm package), Express.js, and Dotenv.
